  "body": "## I'm Jaye Brown, a Product/User Experience Design leader.\r\nCurrently, I am the Director of User Experience for a group of designers at a company that creates business intelligence tools for health care systems. This means I'm well versed in data visualization, design standards, interaction patterns, task and journey matching, etc. I do it all while being what my current boss calls, \"The Great Unifier\". What she means is that I bring Product Management, Design, and Development together in an Agile environment to create products that deliver great outcomes for their users.\r\n\r\nI'm searching for my next opportunity in the New York City area, but I'm also happy to work with you on a remote basis if that's what you need to get your product or product design team to the next level.
